    <p class="h5 mt-5">Thank you for choosing Indian Mentors as your educational partner. We are thrilled to welcome you
      to
      the Indian Mentors family.</p>

      event of dissatisfaction or circumstances requiring a refund, we have outlined our refund policy below for your
      reference :</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <h5 :>Unsatisfactory Service:</h5>
        In case where the client finds our tutoring services unsatisfactory, we encourage them to discuss their concerns
        with us. If we are unable to address their concerns satisfactorily within a reasonable timeframe, the client may
        be eligible for a partial or full refund, depending on the extent of the dissatisfaction.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <h5 :>Service Discontinuation :</h5>
        If the client decides to discontinue our tutoring services, then fees will be adjusted/refunded according to
        following conditions:
        <ol class="mt-4">
          <li>
            <h6 :>Student Registration Fees:</h6>
            Student registration fees are non-refundable under any circumstances.
            However, student registration fees are adjustable with tuition fees if the term of the package is more than
            6
            Months.

            The unavailed classes can be compensated up to 1 financial year for the registered student.
            Additionally, unavailed classes can be compensated for a sibling of the student.
            In exceptionally rare circumstances, a refund will be made for unavailed classes after deduction of 30%
            service
            charges.
          </li>
        </ol>

      <li class="mb-3">
        <h5 :>Cancellation by tutor:</h5>
        If unforeseen circumstances result in the cancellation of a session by the assigned tutor, we will offer the
        client the option to choose another tutor to complete the remaining sessions.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <h5 :>Schedule Conflicts: </h5>
        If the client encounters scheduling conflicts that prevent them from availing the tutoring sessions, they must
        notify us in advance. Depending on the circumstances, we may offer compensatory sessions.

        <h5 :>Refund Process:</h5>

      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <h5 :>Refund Mode:</h5>
        Refunds will be issued using the same method of payment used for the original transaction other than cash unless
        otherwise agreed upon by both parties.
      </li>
      <li class="mb-3">
        <h5 :>Dispute Resolution:</h5>
        In the event of any disputes regarding refunds, both parties agree to engage in good faith negotiations to
        resolve
        the issue amicably. If a resolution cannot be reached, either party may seek legal recourse as per the laws
        governing our jurisdiction.
      </li>
